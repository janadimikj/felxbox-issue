<h1>why is this such a big deal?</h1>

<div class="row">
	<div class="column">
		<div class="c1">
		<p> Columbia University banned two pro-Palestinian student groups for violationg "policy". It was not speccified however which policy. <br>
	The two groups are Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace</p>

	<p>The event for which they were suspended was a walkout followed by an art installation. <br>
	Similar events have been carried out nationwide. Then why did this one result in suspension?</p>

	<p>Columbia University is choosing to surpress student voices in order to suupport donors and investors who prefer there be no protests. <br>
		Student protests integral to bringing awareness to many global issues such as the Vietnam War way back when.<br>
	Today, it is important to acknowledge that student voices can help the cause of ceasefire in Gaza and that it is undeniably important to let student voices speak out on these issues, no matter what investors say.</p>

	<p>"Instead of supporting students’ rights to speak and to mobilize on campus, Columbia has chosen to prioritize suppressing speech on Israel and organizing to end the ongoing genocide and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza."
